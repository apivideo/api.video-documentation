# Video Created

The Video Created Zapier trigger will fire whenever a new video is created at api.video. This trigger is looking for only the [creation of a video](/reference/api/Videos#create-a-video-object). The creation of a video container is not a guarantee of a video being ready (or really that a video will EVER be uploaded).

Once you choose this trigger, and authorize your api.video account with your api key (which you can find on the [dashboard](https://my.api.video)), you can further filter the created videos for specific titles or tags that are being created.

Example uses:

Perhaps you wish to know when a student has begun uploading a video into your class. This alert will tell you (within a minute or two) when the video upload process has started.

Tracking uploads to your api.video account ensures that abuse is not occurring.

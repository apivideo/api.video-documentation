To resolve `Content Security Policy` directive issue and to visualize the thumbnail and the video, we need to configure external ressource like embed.api.videoand cdn.api.video/vod/. Modify the middlewares.js file like below:

```
// config/middlewares.js
module.exports = ({ env }) => [
    'strapi::errors',
    {
        name: 'strapi::security',
        config: {
            contentSecurityPolicy: {
                useDefaults: true,
                directives: {
                    'connect-src': ["'self'", 'https:'],
                    'img-src': ["'self'", 'data:', 'blob:', 'embed.api.video', 'cdn.api.video/vod/'],
                    'frame-src': ["'self'", 'data:', 'blob:', 'embed.api.video'],
                    upgradeInsecureRequests: null,
                },
            },
        },
    },
    'strapi::cors',

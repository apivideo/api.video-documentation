# Live Stream Created

The Live stream created Zapier trigger will fire whenever a new live stream is created at api.video. This trigger is looking for only the [creation of a live stream](/reference/api/Live-Streams#create-live-stream). The creation of a live stream container is not a guarantee of a broadcast starting but more of a way to monitor which of your customers have created a stream.

Once you choose this trigger, you'll authorize your api.video account with your api key (which you can find on the [dashboard](https://my.api.video)). That's all there is to it!

The test will look for a live stream in your account, so before you test the trigger, make sure your account has a live stream:

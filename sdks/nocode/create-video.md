Create Video
============

The *Create video* Zapier step is an action.  Zapier's actions occur after a trigger has been fired. 

With the Create video action - you can create a video on demand file at api.video.  This could be triggered by the presence of a new file on a server. When the new file is created - the "create video" action can create the video, and upload the video into the video container.


For example:  When a new video is uploaded into Amazon S3, you can create a new video, and upload the video (using the publicly available URL) to insert the video into api.video.

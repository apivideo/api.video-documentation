## Documentation for Authorization

### API key

Most endpoints required to be authenticated using the API key mechanism described in our [documentation](https://docs.api.video/reference#authentication).
The access token generation mechanism is automatically handled by the client. All you have to do is provide an API key:
```swift
ApiVideoUploader.apiKey = YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Public endpoints

Some endpoints don't require authentication. These one can be called without setting `ApiVideoUploader.apiKey`:

# Project description

api.video's Swift  for iOS, macOS and tvOS uploads videos to api.video using delegated upload token or API Key.

It allows you to upload videos in two ways:
- standard upload: to send a whole video file in one go
- progressive upload: to send a video file by chunks, without needing to know the final size of the video file

# Getting started

## Installation

### Carthage

Specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```
github "apivideo/api.video-swift-uploader" ~> 1.2.2
```

Run `carthage update`

### CocoaPods

Add `pod 'ApiVideoUploader', '1.2.2'` in your `Podfile`

Run `pod install`

## Code sample

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following Swift code:
```swift
import ApiVideoUploader

// If you rather like to use the sandbox environment:
// ApiVideoUploader.basePath = Environment.sandbox.rawValue

try VideosAPI.uploadWithUploadToken(token: "MY_VIDEO_TOKEN", file: url) { video, error in
    if let video = video {
        // Manage upload with upload token success here
    }
    if let error = error {
        // Manage upload with upload token error here
    }
}
```

## Documentation for Authorization

### API key

Most endpoints required to be authenticated using the API key mechanism described in our [documentation](https://docs.api.video/reference#authentication).

You must NOT store your API key in your application code to prevent your API key from being exposed in your source code.
Only the [Public endpoints](#public-endpoints) can be called without authentication.
In the case, you want to call an endpoint that requires authentication, you will have to use a backend server. See [Security best practices](https://docs.api.video/sdks/security) for more details.

### Public endpoints

Some endpoints don't require authentication. These one can be called without setting `ApiVideoUploader.apiKey`.

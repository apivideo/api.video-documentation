# api.video React Native video uploader

[api.video](https://api.video/) is the video infrastructure for product builders. Lightning fast video APIs for integrating, scaling, and managing on-demand & low latency live streaming features in your app.

## Project description

This module is an easy way to upload video with delegated token to api.video

## Getting started

### Installation

```sh
npm install @api.video/react-native-video-uploader
```

or

```sh
yarn add @api.video/react-native-video-uploader
```

### Code sample

#### Regular upload

```js
import ApiVideoUploader from '@api.video/react-native-video-uploader';

ApiVideoUploader.uploadWithUploadToken('YOUR_UPLOAD_TOKEN', 'path/to/my-video.mp4')
  .then((value: Video) => {
   // Manages success here
  })
  .catch((e: any) => {
    // Manages error here
  });
```

#### Progressive upload

For more details about progressive uploads, see the [progressive upload documentation](https://docs.api.video/vod/progressive-upload).

```js
import ApiVideoUploader from '@api.video/react-native-video-uploader';

(async () => {
  const uploadSession = ApiVideoUploader.createProgressiveUploadSession({token: 'YOUR_UPLOAD_TOKEN'});
  try {
    await session.uploadPart("path/to/video.mp4.part1");
    await session.uploadPart("path/to/video.mp4.part2");
    // ...
    const video = await session.uploadLastPart("path/to/video.mp4.partn");
    // ...
  } catch(e: any) {
    // Manages error here
  }
})();
```

### Android

#### Permissions

Permissions `android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` (for API 33+) or `android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (for API < 33) are in the library manifest and will be requested by this library at runtime. You don't have to request them in your application.

On Android 33+, the upload comes with a notification to show the progress. So if your application targets Android 33+, you might request `android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission at runtime.

When targeting Android API Level 34+, you must declare the service type in your application's manifest file.
In your `AndroidManifest.xml` file, add the following lines in the `<application>` tag:

```xml
    <service
      android:name="androidx.work.impl.foreground.SystemForegroundService"
      android:exported="false"
      android:foregroundServiceType="dataSync" />
```

#### Notifications

To customize the notification to your own brand, you can change the icon, color or channel name by overwriting the following resources in your own application resources:
  - the icon: `R.drawable.ic_upload_notification`
  - the color: `R.color.upload_notification_color`
  - the channel name: `R.string.upload_notification_channel_name`

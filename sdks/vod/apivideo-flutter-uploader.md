# Project description

api.video's Flutter uploader uploads videos to api.video using delegated upload token or API Key.

It allows you to upload videos in two ways:

- standard upload: to send a whole video file in one go
- progressive upload: to send a video file by chunks, without needing to know the final size of the video file

# Getting started

### Installation

Run this command:

```bash
flutter pub add video_uploader
 ```
 
This will add the following lines to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

``` yaml
dependencies:
  video_uploader: ^1.1.0
```

#### For web usage

Add the api.video TypeScript uploader script to your `web/index.html` head.

```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    ...
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@api.video/video-uploader" defer></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```

### Code sample

```dart
import 'package:video_uploader/video_uploader.dart';

var video = await ApiVideoUploader.uploadWithUploadToken("MY_VIDEO_TOKEN", "path/to/my-video.mp4");
```

# Swift Live stream library

[api.video](https://api.video/) is the video infrastructure for product builders. Lightning fast video APIs for integrating, scaling, and managing on-demand & low latency live streaming features in your app.

## Project description

This module is an easy way to broadcast RTMP live stream to [api.video](https://api.video) platform

## Getting started

### Installation

#### Swift Package Manager

In the Project Navigator select your own project. Then select the project in the Project section and click on the Package Dependencies tab. Click on the "+" button at the bottom. Paste the below url on the search bar on the top right. Finaly click on "Add package" button.

```
https://github.com/api.video-swift-live-stream
```
Or add this in your Package.swift
```
  dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/api.video-swift-live-stream.git", from: "1.3.5"),
    ],
```

#### Cocoapods

1. Add the following entry to your Podfile:
```swift
pod 'ApiVideoLiveStream', '1.3.5'
```
2. Then run `pod install`
3. Don’t forget to import `ApiVideoLiveStream` in every file you’d like to use api.video live stream library

#### Carthage
```
github "apivideo/ApiVideoLiveStream.swift" ~> 1.3.5
```

### Permissions
To be able to broadcast, you must update Info.plist with a usage description for camera and microphone

```xml
...
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Your own description of the purpose</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Your own description of the purpose</string>
...
```

### Code sample
1. In ViewController.swift import the library
```swift
import ApiVideoLiveStream
```
2. Create a `ApiVideoLiveStream` object with your default audio and video configuration
```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    var liveStream:  ApiVideoLiveStream?
    @IBOutlet var viewCamera: UIView!
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        let audioConfig = AudioConfig(bitrate: 32 * 1000)
        let videoConfig = VideoConfig(bitrate: 2 * 1024 * 1024, resolution: Resolutions.RESOLUTION_720, fps: 30)
        do {
            liveStream = try ApiVideoLiveStream(initialAudioConfig: audioConfig, initialVideoConfig: videoConfig, preview: preview)
        } catch {
            print (error)
        }
    }
}
```
3. Start your live stream with `startStreaming`
```swift
liveStream?.startStreaming(streamKey: "YOUR_STREAM_KEY")
```
Alternatively, you can use `startStreaming` `url` parameter to set the URL of your RTMP server.

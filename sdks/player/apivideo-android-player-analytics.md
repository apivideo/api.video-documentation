## Project description

This library sends player events from the player to api.video.

## Getting started

### Installation

#### Gradle

For ExoPlayer, add the following code in your module `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'video.api.player.analytics:android-player-analytics-exoplayer:3.0.0'
}
```

### Code sample

Register the ExoPlayer player analytics agent with:

```kotlin
import androidx.media3.exoplayer.ExoPlayer
import video.api.analytics.exoplayer.extensions.addDatabusAgent

val exoplayer = ExoPlayer.Builder(context).build()
val listener =
    exoplayer.addApiVideoAnalyticsListener() // Register the ApiVideo exoplayer analytics listener so it sends player events to api.video.

// Remove the analytics listener when you don't need it anymore.
exoplayer.removeAnalyticsListener(listener)
```

For a custom domain collector, use:

```kotlin
val agent =
    exoplayer.addDatabusAgent(collectorUrl = "https://collector.mycustomdomain.com") // Register the Databus agent so it sends player events to api.video.
```

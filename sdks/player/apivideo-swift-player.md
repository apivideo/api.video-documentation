## Getting started

### Installation

#### Swift Package Manager

Add the following dependency to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
  dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/apivideo/api.video-swift-player-analytics.git", from: "2.0.0"),
    ],
```

#### CocoaPods

Add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'ApiVideoPlayerAnalytics', '~> 2.0.0
```

Then, run `pod install`.

### Code sample

Create a `ApiVideoAnalyticsAVPlayer` instance.

```swift
import ApiVideoPlayerAnalytics

let player = ApiVideoAnalyticsAVPlayer(url: "URL of the HLS manifest") // HLS manifest from api.video. Example: https://vod.api.video/vod/YOUR_VIDEO_ID/hls/manifest.m3u8
```

Then, use it like a regular `AVPlayer`.

```swift
player.play()
```

For a custom domain collector, use:

```swift
let player = ApiVideoAnalyticsAVPlayer(url: "URL of the HLS manifest", collectorUrl: "https://collector.mycustomdomain.com") // Register the player analytics listener so it sends player events to api.video.
```

## Documentation

// TODO

## Sample application

Open `ApiVideoPlayerAnalytics.xcodeproj`.

Replace the default media ID in `Examples/iOS/ViewController.swift` with your own.

```swift
let url = Utils.inferManifestURL(mediaId: "vi77Dgk0F8eLwaFOtC5870yn") // replace `vi77Dgk0F8eLwaFOtC5870yn` with your own media ID
```

Then, run the `Example iOS` target.

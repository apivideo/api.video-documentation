# Using Custom Domains

api.video enables you to deliver video content and provide live streams using your own custom domains. You can decide what custom URL or subdomain you use in your implementation, for example `live.mycustomdomain.com`.

{% include "_partials/dark-light-image.md" dark: "/_assets/delivery-analytics/custom-domains/custom-domains-dark.svg", light: "/_assets/delivery-analytics/custom-domains/custom-domains-light.svg", alt: "A diagram that shows the steps of requesting and using custom domains" %}

You can maintain your company branding by utilizing custom domains in any of these use cases, and more:

- use api.videoâ€™s hosting service and [embed or share video content](/vod/get-started-in-5-minutes) using your own custom domain
- [start a live stream](/live-streaming/create-a-live-stream) using your own custom URL
- use your own custom player to provide video on demand
- embed or share [private videos](/delivery-analytics/video-privacy-access-management.md) through your own custom domain

# Video Source Already Uploaded

You already initiated a content range upload or you already uploaded a full video or you created the video with the download from "source" feature and you try to do one of those things again.

## Solution 

You will have to create a new video container and upload to that instead. You can only upload into a video container one time. Endpoint:
* [Video endpoint](/reference/api/Videos#list-all-video-objects)

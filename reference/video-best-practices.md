Video best practices
====================

## How to create & upload a video

The concept of creating and uploading a video is pretty simple:

1.  **Create a video object:** Think about it as a box or shell for the video. Once you've created a video object, it's an empty shell, however, it has an id and assets.
2.  **Upload a video:** Now you can upload your video into that object.

A tutorial for uploading a video with curl can be found [here](https://api.video/blog/tutorials/video-upload-tutorial)

A more visual representation can be found below:

**Important things to know**
* **All qualities encoding:** The video object will include up to 6 responsive video streams from 240p to 4K
* **Video size:** There's no file size limitation but the files will be compressed to fit delivery needs (4k max def with x264 + aac at 60fps max )
* **Highest quality encoding by default:** Mp4 encoded versions are created at the highest quality (max 4K) by default.
* **360¬∞ videos support:** Panoramic videos are videos recorded in 360¬∞. You can toggle this after your 360¬∞ video upload.
* **Video Access Management:** When creating a video object, it can be either private or public. The feature allows you to change it later by updating the video object.
* **Progressive Upload:** Ability to upload videos in a progressive manner while they are being recorded.

## Progressive video upload & uploading large videos ‚è´

Some videos you might upload could be very large in size. We made sure that this is addressed and that there's a convenient way to upload large videos while breaking them into chunks. Please be sure to read the guide on how to make [progressive video upload](/vod/upload-a-video-regular-upload).

## Video Access Management üîí

The video object will be created as public by default. If you want to make the video private, you just need to create a private video object or update it later. You can read all about Private Videos [here](/delivery-analytics/video-privacy-access-management.md)

* Searchable parameters: title, description, tags and metadata

```shell
$ curl https://ws.api.video/videos \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {access_token} \

-d '{"title" : "My video", "description" : "so many details", "mp4Support" : true }'` 
```

## Create a video from a URL üîó

You can also create a video directly from a video hosted on a third-party server by giving its URI in `source` parameter:

```shell
$ curl https://ws.api.video/videos \
   -H 'Authorization: Bearer {access_token} \

-d '{"source":"http://uri/to/video.mp4", "title":"My video"}'` 
```

In this case, the service will respond `202 Accepted` and ingest the video asynchronously.

## Track users with Dynamic Metadata üîé

Metadata values can be a key:value where the values are predefined, but Dynamic metadata allows you to enter _any_ value for a defined key. To defined a dynamic metadata pair use:

```
"metadata":[{"dynamicKey": "__dynamicKey__"}]
```

The double underscore on both sides of the value allows any variable to be added for a given video session. Added the the url you might have:

```html
<iframe type="text/html" src="https://embed.api.video/vod/vi6QvU9dhYCzW3BpPvPsZUa8?metadata[classUserName]=Doug" width="960" height="320" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
```

This video session will be tagged as watched by Doug - allowing for in-depth analysis on how each viewer interacts with the videos.

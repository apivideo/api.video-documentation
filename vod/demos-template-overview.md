# Demos & Templates

The amount of use cases you can build with [api.video](https://api.video/) is endless, however, sometimes, you need a little help in building your next amazing startup! That’s why we’ve created Templates to help you kickstart your application, without doing all the heavy lifting.

Templates allow you to just clone a pre-built Github repository that was created by [api.video](https://api.video/) with the use case that you would like to achieve. For example, if you want to build a TikTok or YouTube clone, just head over to one of the Templates and follow the instructions in the Github repository.

## How do Templates work?

The Templates are structured in a way where you can:

1. Check out the template demo. See it in action.
2. Clone the Github repo and iterate on top of it, or even change it completely to your liking

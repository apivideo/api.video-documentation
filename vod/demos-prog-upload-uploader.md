# Progressive video uploader

When your user wants to record a video from their web browser, you want to make sure that the recording is available for the user as fast as possible. That's why we've created the concept of Progressive upload.

With progressive upload, you can break the video into chunks and upload it while it is being recorded.

## Features

- Record an upstream video
- Video breaking into chunks
- Upload video chunks

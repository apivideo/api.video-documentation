* United States
* European Union

The primary consideration while selecting the region should be:

* Proximity to the majority of your user base
* Company legal requirements

api.video utilizes a robust CDN service with a vast network of [multiple Points of Presence (POPs) worldwide](https://www.fastly.com/network-map/). Upon a user's request, the video is promptly cached at the CDN edge, ensuring expedited delivery.

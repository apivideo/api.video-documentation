# Cloudinary migration guide

Planning to migrate api.video from Cloudinary? We got you covered!

Using the api.video Import tool, it only takes a couple of clicks to migrate all of your video content from Cloudinary to api.video. The tool only requires your cloud name, API key, and API secret from Cloudinary.

Check out the [Import tool](https://dashboard.api.video/import) to get started.

## What's the cost? 

We understand that when you want to move to a different provider, it takes effort and development resources. You also want to make sure that it is cost-efficient, especially if you are moving to api.video to save costs.

api.video gives you the ability to **migrate for free** and avoid paying anything for encoding!

## Collect Cloudinary credentials

To access your credentials on Cloudinary, simply visit your Dasboard. You will immediately see all credentials you need to start the import process under Product Environment Credentials:
